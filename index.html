        <p class="content">One thing I found about today is a project called <strong>uniwave</strong>.
            <br> A company called <strong>Wave Swells</strong> has created an artificial blow hole that uses waves to create energy.
            <br> As a wave comes it pushes air out of the blow hole and then when the wave receeds, air is sucked in through as turbine to create energy.
            <br> As everything is above the water it is easy to work on and less harmful to the environment.</p>
